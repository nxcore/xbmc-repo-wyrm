To re-enable the download other themes script that was available in previous builds of this skin
you will need to download and unzip the following file into the directory that this file resides.

Location of file is : https://xbmc-repo-wyrm.googlecode.com/files/scripts.zip

Once the contents of the script are in the correct location, the skin will show a previously hidden
button in the Settings/Skin/General menu.  You can now select a number of old themes that are located
on my google code page.

Note, these themes have not been updated in a fair while and will possiblly break some of the skins 
graphics.  Also as these themes are now seldom even accessed and no one has complained that the setting 
is hidden, as from the Frodo build of this skin, this script will no longer be supported.
